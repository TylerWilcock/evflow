# Contributing to Evflow
First, thanks for wanting to contribute to Evflow! This project would be nothing
without you and the amazing PHP community.

## What to help out with
Evflow is still in an early stage at the moment, so most of the contributions
will be related to design and architecture rather than code. These documents can
be found and contributed to in the [docs](http://github.com/evflow/docs)
repository.

## Pull requests
1. Fork the main Evflow repository
2. Make your changes
3. Send a pull request to the master branch

## Style guide
All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

## Licensing
All code contributed will be licensed under Evflow's Apache license, in
accordance with section 5 of the license. See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for
